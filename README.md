# Udacity-Business-Analyst-Nanodegree
Projects for my [Udacity Business Analyst Nanodegree]([https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098)).

## Project 1: Interpret a Data Visualization

A large part of working with data is being able to interpret data visualizations and explain your insights to others. To give you some practice with this, weâ€™ve selected a few Tableau dashboards for you to explore, links are below. Choose one of these dashboards, whichever one interests you the most, and find three insights in the visualizations. For each insight, provide a static image that shares what you found. Write a short report explaining each observation and how you found the information to reach your conclusion from the dashboard.

## Project 2: Analyze Survey Data

In this project, you will analyze a real dataset about current Udacity students across a number of programs, so it isn't perfect. It is a little messy (some things are input incorrectly, others are missing). You will need to decide how to analyze the data and then communicate your findings about it. You will use spreadsheets to make your analysis easier (please do not analyze by hand - it will take forever!).

## Project 3: Query a Digital Music Store Database

In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information.

## Project 4: Data Visualization Using Tableau

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

The data set I worked with came from a Kaggle dataset and it was about flight delays and cacellations.

## Project 4: Data Visualization Using Tableau

In this project, you'll create visualizations to reveal insights from a data set. You will create data visualizations that tell a story or highlight patterns in the data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

The data set I worked with came from a Kaggle dataset and it was about flight delays and cacellations.
